## Accomplishments

### Completed Tasks

#### Landing Page & UI Foundation

- Implemented a minimalistic landing page with responsive design
- Created features section highlighting core functionality (Track Everything, Set Goals, Visualize Progress)
- Established consistent design system using Tailwind CSS with black/white/gray color scheme
- Built reusable UI components (Button, Card, Input, Label, Form) using Radix UI primitives
- Location: `app/page.tsx`, `components/ui/*`

#### Authentication System

- Integrated Supabase authentication with email/password
- Implemented sign-up and sign-in flows with form validation
- Created authentication context (`lib/auth-context.tsx`) for managing user state across the application
- Added protected route logic to redirect unauthenticated users
- Implemented sign-out functionality
- Location: `app/auth/page.tsx`, `lib/auth-context.tsx`, `lib/supabase.ts`

#### Dashboard

- Built authenticated dashboard with navigation bar
- Created placeholder statistics cards (Today's Calories, Weekly Average, Streak)
- Implemented quick action links to meal tracking
- Added user email display and sign-out button
- Location: `app/dashboard/page.tsx`

#### Meal Tracking & Database Integration

- Designed and implemented meals database table in Supabase
- Created full CRUD functionality for meal entries:
  - Add meals with food name, calories, and date
  - View all user meals sorted by creation date
  - Delete meals with confirmation dialog
- Implemented real-time calorie calculation and display
- Added form validation and error handling
- Integrated Supabase queries with proper user filtering (`user_id`)
- Location: `app/meals/page.tsx`

#### API Integrations & External Services

- Successfully obtained USDA FoodData Central API Key for accessing comprehensive nutritional database
- Prepared OpenAI endpoint integration for intelligent food recognition and nutritional data parsing
- These integrations will enable automated nutritional information lookup and enhanced user experience when logging meals

#### Project Infrastructure

- Set up Next.js 16 with React 19
- React Hook Form for form management
- Set up Supabase client configuration

## Challenges

### Outstanding Task: User Onboarding

The user onboarding flow has not been implemented yet. This includes:

- Profile setup form for new users
- Daily calorie goal configuration
- User preferences collection (height, weight, activity level, dietary restrictions)
- Onboarding wizard/flow to guide new users through initial setup

This feature is required for Phase 1 completion and will be prioritized in the next sprint.

### Technical Considerations

- Need to design database schema for user profiles and preferences
- Must ensure onboarding flow integrates smoothly with existing authentication
- Should consider whether onboarding is mandatory or optional for first-time users

### Schedule Status

We are slightly behind schedule due to the incomplete user onboarding feature, but all other Phase 1 requirements have been successfully completed. The core functionality (authentication, meal tracking, database integration) is working as expected.

## Sprint Plans

### Next Sprint Period (2 weeks)

#### Priority 1: Complete User Onboarding (Phase 1)

- **Design user profile database schema** in Supabase
  - Create `user_profiles` table with fields: daily_calorie_goal, height, weight, age, gender, activity_level
  - Set up proper foreign key relationships with auth users
- **Implement onboarding UI flow**
  - Create multi-step onboarding wizard or single-page form
  - Build form validation and data persistence
  - Redirect new users to onboarding after first sign-up
- **Update dashboard to use real user data**
  - Replace placeholder stats with actual user goals from profile
  - Calculate daily calorie remaining based on user's goal and logged meals

#### Priority 2: Implement API Integrations

- **Integrate USDA FoodData Central API**
  - Create API client for food database lookups
  - Implement food search functionality with autocomplete
  - Parse and display nutritional information (calories, macros, serving sizes)
- **Integrate OpenAI API**
  - Build intelligent food recognition from user descriptions
  - Parse natural language meal descriptions into structured data
  - Enhance meal logging experience with AI assistance

#### Priority 3: Begin Phase 2 Tasks

- Review Phase 2 requirements from Sprint #2 planning document
- Start preliminary work on next phase features
- Consider enhancements to existing features based on initial testing

#### Additional Activities

- Test all existing features for bugs and edge cases
- Ensure responsive design works across different screen sizes
- Document any database schema changes
- Prepare for Status Check-In #2
